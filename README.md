The MeshCore SAME EAS Alerter is a lightweight tool designed to forward warnings, emergencies, or statements sent over the air to a local MeshCore network. It operates without needing a WiFi connection. The setup involves connecting the hosting computer to an RTL SDR via USB and to a running MeshCore Companion node via serial or TCP.

Other operating systems may have a different installation



## 🖋️ Usage
### By default the alerter will find a connected node that is connected via serial or on local host

### RTL FM input
- You must pass in the input from an rtl fm stream
- For a detailed installation guide of rtl_fm check out the Installation instructions
- Set the desired frequency to the nearest National Weather Service radio station typically in the 162.40 to 162.55 MHz range
```
rtl_fm -f <FREQUENCY_IN_HZ_HERE> -s 48000 -r 48000 | MeshCore-SAME-EAS-Alerter
```
> The frequency input is in Hz not MHz

### help
```
MeshCore-SAME-EAS-Alerter --help
```

### host
- Enter the address of the TCP host to connect to, in the form of IP:PORT
```
MeshCore-SAME-EAS-Alerter --host <TCP_HOST_HERE>
```

### port
- Enter the serial port to connect to, in the form of /dev/ttyACM0
```
MeshCore-SAME-EAS-Alerter --port <SERIAL_PORT_HERE>
```

### alert channel  
- Input the channel number that alerts will be sent to  
- By default, (if nothing is provided) alerts will be sent to channel number 0  
```
MeshCore-SAME-EAS-Alerter --alert-channel <CHANNEL_NUMBER_HERE>
```

### test channel  
- Input the channel number that test messages will be sent to  
  - Usually test messages are transmitted weekly from the weather service station  
  - These messages can help you tell if your system is working but they can be annoying as they happen often  
- By default, (if nothing is provided) test messages will be ignored  
```
MeshCore-SAME-EAS-Alerter --test-channel <CHANNEL_NUMBER_HERE>
```

### sample rate
- Input the sampling rate of the input
- Do not modify this if you do not know what you are doing
- Default is 48000
```
MeshCore-SAME-EAS-Alerter --rate <SAMPLING_RATE_HERE>
```

### locations
- Input the location codes of counties you want to filter for
- If a alert does not contain the counties you are filtering for it will be ignored
- By default if this arg is not provided all alerts will be sent of all locations (Most likley your local NWS will only alert of nearby alerts)
- National alerts override this
- Look in [sameCodes](src/sameCodes.csv) to find the county codes to use
```
MeshCore-SAME-EAS-Alerter --locations <LOCATIONS_HERE>
```
example:    
```
MeshCore-SAME-EAS-Alerter --locations 006085,006087
```


### Full example
- You need both a MeshCore serial port passed as an arg and rtl fm to run this
- Alert channel and test channel are optional (see above)
- By default (if host is not provided) the alerter will find a node that is connected via serial or on local host
````
rtl_fm -f <FREQUENCY_IN_HZ_HERE> -s 48000 -r 48000 | MeshCore-SAME-EAS-Alerter --alert-channel <CHANNEL_NUMBER_HERE> --test-channel <CHANNEL_NUMBER_HERE>
````
or
````
rtl_fm -f <FREQUENCY_IN_HZ_HERE> -s 48000 -r 48000 | MeshCore-SAME-EAS-Alerter --host <TCP_HOST_HERE> --alert-channel <CHANNEL_NUMBER_HERE> --test-channel <CHANNEL_NUMBER_HERE>
````
or
````
rtl_fm -f <FREQUENCY_IN_HZ_HERE> -s 48000 -r 48000 | MeshCore-SAME-EAS-Alerter --port <SERIAL_PORT_HERE> --alert-channel <CHANNEL_NUMBER_HERE> --test-channel <CHANNEL_NUMBER_HERE>

## Automated Service Install
Once you have installed and tested that everything works correctly you can run the following scripts to autorun after reboot.
````
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mambo430/MeshCore-SAME-EAS-Alerter/refs/heads/main/meshcore-same-eas-alerter.sh
sudo chmod +x meshcore-same-eas-alerter.sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mambo430/MeshCore-SAME-EAS-Alerter/refs/heads/main/meshcore-same-eas-alerter.service
sudo cp meshcore-same-eas-alerter.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable meshcore-same-eas-alerter.service
sudo systemctl start meshcore-same-eas-alerter.service
````

Make sure to change the username from `pi` to the correct username for your environment. Also, make sure to change the device `-d` and `--port` in the script to the correct ones for your setup.
